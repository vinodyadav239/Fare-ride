🔹 ER Diagram (Database Design)

Entities:

Student (student_id, name, phone, hostel, etc.)

Driver (driver_id, name, vehicle_no, license_no, availability_status)

Ride (ride_id, student_id, driver_id, pickup, drop, fare, status)

Payment (payment_id, ride_id, amount, method, timestamp)


Relationships:

Student books Ride

Driver assigned to Ride

Ride has Payment

🔹 System Architecture

(insert 3-tier diagram)

1. Presentation Layer: Web/App (Student & Driver UI)


2. Application Layer: API for booking, matching, notifications


3. Data Layer: Database for users, rides, payments
